I developed this personal website to showcase my portfolio and
communicate with other professionals in the industry. It has home,
porfolio and about pages. About page sheds a little light on me
as a person and my interests outside the professional life. This
project is developed using HTML, CSS and some JQuery. CSS
variables and hsl used to keep color scheme as dynamic as possible
so that it can be changed conveniently.
